# Raw Idea: Multiple Service Registrations

**Roadmap Item:** 5

**Size:** L (Large)

**Description:**

Start a `HopscotchInjector` that is based on the `KeywordInjector`. Add support for registering multiple implementations of the same protocol interface, storing them as a collection of registrations with metadata (factory, context, location) that will be resolved based on request-time criteria.
