# Raw Idea: Basic Examples and Documentation

## Feature Description (from Roadmap #4)

Create foundational examples demonstrating core DI patterns (simple injection, protocol usage, custom construction) with corresponding tests in `tests/` and documentation in `docs/examples/*.md`. Include examples from initial spec as starting point.

## Size Estimate
Medium (M)

## Status
Not started

## Context
This is feature #4 from the product roadmap. It builds upon the completed features:
1. Core Type-Safe Dependency Injection (completed)
2. Custom Construction with `__svcs__` (completed)

This feature forms part of the minimal viable core of svcs-di focused on type-safe DI (items 1-4 in roadmap).
